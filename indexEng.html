                <h1>Environmental Problem: Lack of Recycling</h1>
                <br><br>
                <p> The lack of recycling causes serious environmental problems, starting with the accumulation of waste in landfills, which become overcrowded and contaminate the soil and groundwater. This pollution negatively affects the local flora and fauna. Additionally, not recycling increases the exploitation of natural resources, requiring the extraction of raw materials, which consumes more energy and results in more greenhouse gas emissions. These actions intensifies climate change, causing extreme phenomena such as droughts, floods and other subsequent natural disasters, which harm the health of the planet and it’s well being.</p>

                <h1>Lack of Recycling Consequences:</h1><br><br>
                <p> 
                    The incorrect disposal of materials have a significant impact not only in our country but also worldwide, affecting both social and financial aspects. According to Abrelpe (Brazilian Association of Public Cleaning Companies and Special Waste), Brazil loses approximately 14 billion reals due to improper waste disposal, in addition to other consequences such as the spreading of diseases, floods, increased electricity consumption, among others.</p>

                <h1>Technology</h1>
                <p> The innovative technology we created is called “RecycleBot” which consists of a bin programmed to properly separate solid waste into their respective containers using artificial intelligence to differentiate one object from another. The bin contains special storage compartments inside for proper disposal of discarded material. This bin undergoes various adjustments before being fully utilized in the job market, and it is ideal for sustainability-focused benefits.</p>
